# JavaScript Tutorial: Amazon Project

Welcome to the **JavaScript Tutorial: Amazon Project**! This repository contains the code I wrote while following an excellent JavaScript course by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev) on YouTube. The course covers the fundamentals of JavaScript, guiding learners from beginner to pro.

## Project Overview

This project simulates an Amazon-like e-commerce platform, providing hands-on experience with various JavaScript concepts and features as taught in the course. The key topics covered include:

- **Fetch API**: Handling HTTP requests to interact with APIs.
- **Async/Await**: Writing asynchronous code that reads like synchronous code.
- **Promises**: Managing asynchronous operations effectively.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Creating and managing objects, classes, and inheritance.
- **Testing**: Writing tests to ensure your code is reliable and bug-free.
- **And More**: Explore other advanced JavaScript features and best practices.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Display products dynamically fetched from a simulated API.
- **Shopping Cart**: Implement add-to-cart functionality with real-time updates.
- **Order Management**: Simulate order processing and order history tracking.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is accessible on all devices.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this project, I've been able to:

1. Gain a solid understanding of modern JavaScript syntax and features.
2. Learn how to work with asynchronous operations and manage data flow.
3. Develop skills in testing JavaScript code for quality assurance.
4. Apply object-oriented principles in real-world scenarios.
5. Enhance problem-solving abilities through practical coding challenges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- Familiarity with JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, loops, etc.).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GCarido/javascript-amazon-project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
